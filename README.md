# 🤖 Project Erasmus — Reasoning Engine

Project Erasmus is a local, containerized reasoning engine designed to analyze software system data, visualize relationships, and generate GenAI-powered insights. Inspired by Erasmus from *Dune*, it explores how local AI can reason about real-world software risks.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Parses SBOMs generated by Syft CLI (CycloneDX JSON)
* Runs Grype CLI scans to detect CVEs
* Joins in metadata from `vendor_geo.csv` to add vendor HQ + region context
* Visualizes data and vulnerability trends in a Streamlit dashboard
* Integrates **Ollama** with a dropdown to switch between 3 local GenAI models for contextual summaries and Q\&A
* Fully Dockerized — portable, offline, and reproducible

---

## 🧠 Why Local LLMs?

Erasmus lets you query your data *entirely offline* using:

* `qwen2.5-coder:7b` → for technical/structured SBOM interpretation
* `gemma:2b` → for lightweight analysis, fast on M1/M2 chips
* `openhermes:latest` → for broader contextual or general summaries

Each model serves a different thinking style. You can switch between them using the Streamlit UI dropdown.

## ✨ Optional Enhancements (paid or enterprise)

For users who want to go deeper:

* Append data from commercial APIs like IPinfo, WHOISXML, or Crunchbase to auto-fill vendor HQ, size, and sector
* Add package popularity or maturity ratings using OSS Index or Libraries.io
* Feed results into a GRC tool for automated software supplier risk scoring

---

## 🏗 Tech stack

* **Syft CLI** → SBOM generation
* **Grype CLI** → vulnerability scanning
* **Python + pandas** → metadata joining + preprocessing
* **Streamlit** → visual dashboard with interactive LLM input
* **Ollama** → GenAI summarization + Q\&A using local models
* **Docker + Compose** → fully containerized environment

## 💻 Setup & Usage

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stoic-dad/project-erasmus.git
cd project-erasmus
```

Build and run:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Then visit the dashboard at:
👉 [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)

---

## ⚙ Requirements

* Docker (with Compose)
* Optional: [Ollama](https://ollama.com) installed locally to run LLMs
* SBOMs and `vendor_geo.csv` in the proper folder structure (see repo)

---

## 🧠 Philosophy

This project is a hands-on exploration of combining GenAI, software system complexity, and reasoning. Named after Erasmus — the AI thinker from *Dune* — it’s built for curious engineers who want to:

* Visualize what software they're running
* Ask natural-language questions about supply chain risk
* Work locally without sending data to the cloud

Let’s make software bill of materials *reason about themselves.*
